TODO:

1) when POST is successful for new shortened URL, should go to /links



ADDED:

1. added a .otherwise in the routeProvider in app.js
    maybe handles all non specified route paths??


2. for TODO #1, added a location.path in shorten.js to change views.
  need to add error handling for addOne

3. Broke authentication, need to look at the otherwise to see why that
   seems to be stopping auth from happening
